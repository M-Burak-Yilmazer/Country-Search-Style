# Country-Search-Style
Yesterday, I created a countries project with the data I received from an api, I completed my project by selecting the countries in the list from the selectbox. today I have completed a project that allows me to select the data I want by entering the searched data into the input field by narrowing the data I want.
I think I have added a lot to my knowledge with this project. continue to work without a break ...
